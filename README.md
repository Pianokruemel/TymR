# TymR - Calendar ICS Viewer for Android

TymR is an Android application that allows users to subscribe to iCalendar (ICS) feeds and view upcoming events directly on their device. The app features a home screen widget and persistent notifications to keep you informed about your next appointment.

## Features

- **Multiple Calendar Sources**: Subscribe to any number of ICS calendar feeds
- **Home Screen Widget**: See your upcoming events at a glance on your home screen
- **Persistent Notifications**: Stay informed about your next event
- **Automatic Updates**: Calendar data is automatically refreshed daily
- **Manual Refresh**: Force refresh calendars whenever you want
- **Customizable Display**: Choose what information to show in notifications and widgets

## How It Works

TymR downloads and parses ICS calendar files from the URLs you provide. It automatically updates your calendar data daily when you're connected to the internet, and it shows your current or upcoming event in a notification and on the home screen widget.

### Widget

The home screen widget displays:
- The title of your current or next event
- The time remaining until it starts or ends
- Event time and location (if enabled)

### Notifications

The persistent notification displays:
- The title of your current or next event
- Whether the event is ongoing or upcoming
- Time remaining until start/end
- Event time and location (if enabled)
